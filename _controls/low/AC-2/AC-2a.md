The Application system owner (SO) should ensure its applications provide a way to manage userâ€™s access using identifiers
(i.e. individual, group, system, application, guest/anonymous, and temporary)
if required and not handled by the 18F DevOps team.

The Data.gov team coordinates with the US Federal Geographic Data Committee @FGDC who provides a SAML based login to interoperate between geo.data.gov and catalog.data.gov. That Social Auth is covered by the Department of Interior's ATO which manages the boundary for this feature. This feature's inter-connnection occurs at the front-end WordPress level to share users for co-manage content. This interconnection would occur as an cloud.gov - cloud foundry based deployment. We stand to inherit both DOI/18F existing controls in codebase by @FGDC and network and platform by @18F.
